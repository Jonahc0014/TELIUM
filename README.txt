This is a game (made in python) where you travel around a spaceship.
There is a queen alien called Telium who has infiltrated the ship.
Your task is to locate, contain and kill Telium to save the ship, it's crew and its expensive equipment.
You can lock doors, use scnners to check the power, fuel and where the queen is to help you.
This progam was started in my school as a fun project but has grown into a full on program fro the public
Most of the code was from a structure frame made by Craig Sargent and David Hillyard, deepest thanks to them for
jump starting the project. Thank you to my teacher who intorduced me and jack to the Telium idea
and thanks to all the small snippets of code gracefully donated to the open scorce community, all links can be found in the code

Have fun!
